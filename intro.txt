Java is a programming language designed in 1995 by James Gosling but later was adopted by Oracle.
You need to setup JDK in order to write, compile execute and edit codes in java.
you can download JDK(Java Development Kit) from oracle website by browsing "JDK download". And you need an IDE(Integrated Development Enviroment)
like Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ IDEA to write, compile and execute java code. You can download any of them but as for me vs code is quite better as for 
java development. You can download it from official website of vs code. You can also use online compilers.
vs code editor is free and light weighted.
