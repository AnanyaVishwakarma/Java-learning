Programming helps us to build softwares or applications. Why? because an application helps in solving REAL WORLD problems with the help of VIRTUAL WORLD.
this problem solving is done through and on data,  
input data -> data process -> output; while processing the data, we need to store data somewhere, that's when the term "Variables" comes to action 
these Variables are storage like thingy in Programming which stores data to process it.
diffrent storages for diffrent types of data(e.g. number, text, img, audio etc.) in normal case java is different.
# Every statement ends with a semicolon ";" and every block of code ends and start with parenthesis "{}" #
    Datatype  variable          value__a semicolon to end the statement
    int       num          =     35;
